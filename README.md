This is my submission for the VBA-challenge.

I've included my VBA script, which is titled StocksScript.vbs and I've included 3 screenshots of the results - one for each worksheet.

My script loops through the data on each worksheet, creates new column labels, stores and outputs values of new columns along with open and close prices. It also adds conditional formatting to the yearly change and percent change columns, calculates greatest increase, greatest decrease, and greatest total volume, and pulls their matching tickers values.
